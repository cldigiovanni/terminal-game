# Game in a Terminal: Terminal Game
## The game that runs in your terminal

This is just a fun side project for me. I have been wanting to make a game that 
runs in the terminal for a while now, and it might as well be on Github. Maybe it 
will turn into something greater? Who knows. I just love programming.

### Future plans
Maybe a fun challenge would be to make a "virtual machine" that runs the game, 
so that I only have to write the game once, and it can run wherever I write
a working copy of the virtual machine.
