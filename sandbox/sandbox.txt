the purpose of the sandbox folder is to have a place to work with ideas
before adding them into the full structure of the game :)

mechanics:
- items have triggers
- triggers have effects
- effects create items
- your inventory is essentially a cellular automata

You start with three inventory slots and one item that deals one damage to an enemy
